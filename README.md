            "long_biography": "A German artisan's son, child prodigy Domenico Campagnola probably learned from his adopted father, who instructed him in painting, drawing, engraving, and woodcutting. After his father's death around 1516, Campagnola was Venice's foremost printmaker. He innovated bycuttingwoodblocks himself rather than employing a professional woodcutter. His earliest prints and drawings show the influence of German artist Albrecht Dï¿½rer. Campagnola's lush, flowing style and religious subject matter may also indicate access to Titian's workshop.By around 1520 Campagnola moved to Padua, where he became its busiest and most praised painter. Hisfrescoesand easel paintings for churches and palaces betray his Venetian origins with their asymmetrical compositions and rich treatment of fabrics. Nevertheless, he remained most celebrated for hiswoodcutsand landscape drawings, which he sold as finished compositions. He drew raised foregrounds set against poetic vistas of paths, castles, bridges, and ruins, with jagged peaks of distant mountains.",
